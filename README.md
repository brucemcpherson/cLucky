This namespace contains a bunch of useful methods to generate random lists and strings. It's plain JavaScript so works on both Apps Script or client side JavaScript.

The main features are
- creating random strings, arrays and grids
- limiting used values using ranges, regular expressions and lists
- shuffling strings and arrays
- using seed values and phrases to create repeatable randomness
- unshuffling previously shuffled arrays and strings using the seed values they were shuffled with
